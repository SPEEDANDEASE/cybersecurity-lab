# CVSS – Common Vulnerability Scoring System

CVSS is a standardized way to assess the severity of security vulnerabilities.  
It produces a score between 0.0 and 10.0 based on exploitability and impact.


## Mock Security Advisory

**CVE-2025-12345**  
- **Severity:** Critical (CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 9.8)  
- **Summary:** Remote code execution vulnerability in XYZ Web Server v4.2, allowing unauthenticated attackers to execute arbitrary code.  
- **CVSS Vector:** `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`  
- **Impact:** Full system compromise possible.  
- **Recommendation:** Upgrade to XYZ Web Server v4.3 immediately.

## CVSS Vector Explained

- **AV:N** – Attack Vector: Network  
- **AC:L** – Attack Complexity: Low  
- **PR:N** – Privileges Required: None  
- **UI:N** – User Interaction: None  
- **S:U** – Scope: Unchanged  
- **C:H** – Confidentiality: High  
- **I:H** – Integrity: High  
- **A:H** – Availability: High
