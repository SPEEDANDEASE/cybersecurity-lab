# Advanced Network Scanning with Nmap

## Goals
Practicing deeper enumeration techniques with `nmap` to map networks and identify systems accurately.

## Commands Practiced

1. **Scan an Entire Subnet**
   `bash
   sudo nmap -sT <target>/subnet`
Detects all active hosts on the network.

2. **Detect Operating System**
`bash
nmap -O <target>`
Attempts to identify the OS of the target machine.

3. **Scan Specific Ports**
`bash
nmap -p <port> <target>`
Useful for checking whether a particular service is open.

4. **Output to a Readable File**
`bash
nmap -sn -O -oN filename.txt`
Saves the scan result in a human-readable .txt format.
