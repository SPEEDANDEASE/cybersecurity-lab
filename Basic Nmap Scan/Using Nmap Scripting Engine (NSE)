# Using Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

## What Is NSE?
The Nmap Scripting Engine is a powerful feature of `nmap` that uses prewritten **scripts** to automate scanning, vulnerability detection, and much more.

## Why NSE?
Instead of memorizing complex commands, NSE scripts allow you to:
- Identify services and vulnerabilities
- Perform brute force or version scans
- Save time and get deeper results

## How to Find Scripts
```bash
cd /usr/share/nmap/scripts

How to Use NSE Scripts
nmap --script=<script-name> <target>

example:
This script probes HTTP services for directories, logins, and more.
nmap --script=http-enum 192.168.54.101
